 This is a strictly PHP ecommerce site with a pinch of BS4, JS, Sweetalert & FontAwesome5
 
 this site was created as personal project to showcase my strength in PHP by employing various object oriented principles such as:
 - classes
 - objects
 - inheritence
 - static methods & properties
 - encapsulation
 
 amongst many other.
 
 The layout is rather simple but the effort in the backend is quite noticeable and the use of [MVC](https://www.google.com/search?q=php+mvc&rlz=1C1GCEA_enZA916ZA916&oq=php+mvc&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j0i512l4j0i20i263i512l2j0i512l2.2321j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) design made the difference.
 
 ## The Project includes some of these standard ECommerce features:
 - customer login & registration (visitors can also use the application without having to use the auth functionality)
 - customer registration comes with an email verification feature (so when testing please provide real email address for a real user experience)
 - store content browsing
 - customers can view products by category and be able to read each product info by clicking on the desired product
 - customers can add desired products to cart by selecting their product as well as colour & size
 - customer cart are stored in the database for registered customer and as cookies for unregistered customer(which expires in 5days)
 - customer can view items in their carts
 - customer can remove item from their carts
 - customer can checkout
 - on checkout, customer will have to provide(fake), shipping and payment information
 - after checkout customer will get an electronic receipt of their purchase.
 
 ### on paper some of these specs might seem boring but i had a real fun time writing most of these features. some of them include error checking, error handling and status updates in one of the coolest ways possible.

For testing purposes a live copy of this application can be found: ***[here](https://ph-ecommerce.000webhostapp.com/)***

but if you want to run the code on your localhost server follow the instructions below:
- download the source code
- create ***ecommerce*** file in your *htdocs*(xampp) or *www*(wamp)
- copy and paste your downloaded source code into that ecommerce file
- create a ***ecommerce*** database in your *phpmyadmin*
- upload the ***ecommerce.sql*** file found in the *ecommerce* folder
- then run the application on your favorite browser.

### I'm off to my next project. *enjoy*
